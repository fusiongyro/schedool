Refactoring ideas.

The overall intended functions are:

  mirror   -- make a local mirror of the HTML we'll be parsing
  update   -- parse the local mirror and produce our local database
  
Then once you have a database you can use:

  schedql  -- a query language that generates valid schedules
  whatnow  -- suggests what courses to take based on what your
              major is and what you've already taken
  webschd  -- a web-based schedule editor
